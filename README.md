PoktBot is a Telegram bot that was born with the mission of helping with the daily tracking of PocketNetwork nodes and their staking rewards.  

The bot is highly configurable, allowing to track many nodes at once, to generate graph/reports of rewards and to retrieve notifications based on detected errors and status, among other functionalities.
